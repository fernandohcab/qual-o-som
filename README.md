This is a simple game that the player needs to guess the object that made the sound he listened. 
In each level there will be four different options for him to choose. Obviously, only one will be the correct answer. 
Every time he chooses the correct answer, he receives a certain amount of coins that can be used to buy tips for each level.
If he chooses the wrong answer, he will lose one of his lives (the player has 10 lives in total). The lives are recharged at each five minutes.
The game is not yet complete. I need to make a few performance optimizations and finish implementing the rest of the game functions.
